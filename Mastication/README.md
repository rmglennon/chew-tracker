# Mastication Sensor

The mastication sensor uses an Arduino and a potentiometer, hooked up to pin A0, to measure when a
user masticates, or chews their food.

There are multiple tuning parameters as part of this code, allowing for better detection based on
what potentiometer and headgear used to attach to the users head.
